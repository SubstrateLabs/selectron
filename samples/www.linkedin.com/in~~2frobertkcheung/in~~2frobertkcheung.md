This is going to be made possible by AI Agents ðŸ¤– This summer, we developed a perspective on the breakthroughs and potential investment opportunities within AI Agent infrastructure through interviews/insights from industry leaders shaping the future of AI Agents like Lauren Nemeth (COO of Pinecone ), Lin Qiao (CEO of Fireworks AI ), Mike Knoop (Co-Founder &amp; Head of AI at Zapier ), Philip Rathle (CTO at Neo4j ) and more. In the article below, we explore the current state of AI Agent Infrastructure, and examine some potential investment theses. Thank you to Prerit Das for your collaboration and co-authorship on this research! â€¦more Investment Opportunities in AI Agent Infrastructure Jonathan Shriftman

It was eye-opening to see the types of problems that companies are solving for to enable the next leap forward in AI. ðŸªœ Rob Cheung of Substrate spoke about some of the infrastructure challenges with hashtag # GenAI , and why the world needs a compute engine optimized for multi-step AI workloads to reduce bottlenecks. ðŸ’¡ Justin Strnatko presented SingleStore 's solution for a "data platform to transact, analyze, and contextualize data in real time." And this isn't like when somebody says they "need data realtime," by which they mean "weekly." We're talking true realtime on the order of milliseconds here. I found SingleStore's unified architecture that can store many different kinds of data, including vectors, in a SQL database intriguing (still curious exactly how that works). ðŸ•º Tim Spann ðŸ¥‘ of Zilliz shared an interesting project of his doing realtime estimation of human poses using edge AI accelerated hardware. Using a Raspberry Pi 5, he processes realtime video streams from an edge camera to (1) identify people and (2) determine the "stick figure" representation of their pose. Then the results were (3) sent in realtime to a vector DB and Slack channels. I didn't get a great picture of it in action, but it really did what was intended. Super interesting demonstration of what commodity hardware can potentially do these days. I'll be thinking about all the possibilities for real-world applications now! Thanks to AICamp for organizing this great event! â€¦more Activate to view larger image, 1/8 Activate to view larger image,
