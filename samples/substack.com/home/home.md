Substack is in danger of collapsing under its own weight. There are just too many worthy accounts here now to expect readers to cough up $5 for every writer they want to read. There needs to be some kind of subscription/revenue sharing mechanism so subscribers aren‚Äôt constantly asked for money for every damned article they‚Äôd like to read. Sell tokens. Punchcards. Come on, SS, INNOVATE ALREADY.

I do all my work to escape myself. I don't believe in looking into yourself. If you do this, you just discover a lot of shit. The truth is not deep in ourselves. The truth is outside.

my friend &amp; i were riffing on what a zero cost world might actually mean. not just cheap stuff, like literally everything trending toward zero. food, housing, services. even love.

for that to happen, you roughly only need three things: agi, robotics, &amp; near free energy.

&amp; humanity‚Äôs made more progress on all three in the past 10 years than in the entire history of civilization. which is kinda ridiculous to think about.

wrote a post about it below.

Amazon tried to show customers how much tariffs were adding to prices - then seemingly walked it back after a call from Trump. The 2025 economy isn‚Äôt a market, it‚Äôs a stage!

New essay on economic distortion, AI sycophancy, Trump‚Äôs tariff theater, and why clarity is the scarcest commodity of all.

If there was a village somewhere full of true opt-out people who have quit all modern tech, you wouldn‚Äôt hear about it at all. It would be an antimemetic village. Not even an opt-out brand like Amish.

Why even bother being upset about your job being automated if you're a knowledge worker? Aren't you trying to change the world? Don't you want your job to be automated so you can spend more time changing the world?

I do the job because the job needs to get done, not because it's the only job I know how to do. Thank God my job is being automated. That's one less thing I have to do to accomplish the changes I want to see.

LLMs don't just generate media, they are a new narrative medium, akin to the advent of printed books, radio, and film.

I've been experimenting with this new medium at Portola, and it's working: we have 800k+ downloads, a #1 app store ranking, and millions in ARR.

This is what we've learned so far.

I know lots of pope-watchers pine for a Leo XIV or a Pius XIII for zeal for social teaching and doctrinal clarity, respectively. I get that.

But given the immensity of the threats to human dignity the next decades hold, a John Paul III deserves more thought.

The coming years are going to include the mainstreaming of eugenics, abortion, euthanasia, and the commodification of children and the person way beyond what normies understand right now.

my post about ‚Äúbeing yourself‚Äù earlier went viral so i wrote a slight extension to it.

the deepest human craving is to feel fully seen without needing to explain yourself.

to say what you mean without crafting a script.

to be weird, loud, quiet, messy, curious, wrong &amp; still welcomed.

being yourself is the ultimate freedom.

being yourself is the whole game
