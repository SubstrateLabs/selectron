Always use [logger.py](mdc:src/selectron/internal/logger.py) to log:

```py
from .internal.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
```

- ALWAYS catch granular exceptions where possible and log the exception. NEVER use bare except.
- Logs should be:
    1. Focused (do not log in a redundant or overly noisy way. The signal to noise ratio should be high).
    2. Concise and well-formatted (pretty-format JSON, use newlines to wrap long content, truncate potentially long values injected into format strings)
    3. Prefixed with "NOTE:" or "TODO:" to call out subtleties or future work
- If you see redundant or unnecessary logging, clean up! "Leave no trace"
- Keep logs serious and minimal: no emoji.
