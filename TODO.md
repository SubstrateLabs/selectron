- parser generation workflow
- sdk? 
  - eval function?
app
- duckdb?

## polish
- handle multiple selectors + parsers per url?
- organize prompts, always use dedent?
- allow configuring model in tui?

## publish
- readme
- CI

## issues
- many tool calls in selector proposal can result in exceeding context length
  - trimmed down tool results so might be better (see selector_tools constants to tune)
